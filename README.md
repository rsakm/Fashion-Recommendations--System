# Fashion Recommender System
FASHION RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
Fashion recommendation system is recommendation system that provides recommendation 
to the consumer proposing a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network and the Nearest 
neighbor backed recommender. The neural networks are trained and then an inventory is selected 
for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in inventory. The nearest 
neighbour’s algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the input image and 
recommendations are generated.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
With an increase in the standard of living, peoples' attention gradually moved towards fashion that 
is concerned to be a popular aesthetic expression. Humans are inevitably drawn towards 
something that is visually more attractive. This tendency of humans has led to the development of 
the fashion industry over the course of time. However, given too many options of garments on the 
e-commerce websites, has presented new challenges to the customers in identifying their correct 
outfit. Thus, in this project, we proposed a personalized Fashion Recommender system that 
generates recommendations for the user based on an input given. Unlike the conventional 
systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image 
of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people 
see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that. We 
use neural networks to process the images from Fashion Product Images Dataset and the Nearest 
neighbour backed recommender to generate the final recommendations.
OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
The main objective of this fashion recommendation system is to develop a model such that 
we can find the required fashion designs on the basis of an image by scanning it. The main 
objectives are:
• Improve user experience
• Provides customers choices on the basis of images.
• Increase in sells.
• Strikes the right balance between randomness and specificity.
• Simple and effective desired fashion recommendation
